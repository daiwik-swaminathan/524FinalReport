\begin{abstract}
This project explores the feasibility of monitoring a user's network traffic by tricking them into connecting to a rogue access point. We discuss the security implications, methodologies for data capture, and potential countermeasures. Our findings highlight the ease of exploiting unsecured networks and the importance of user awareness.

\section{Introduction}
Network security remains a critical concern in the modern digital landscape. This project investigates how an attacker could intercept a user's web activity by setting up a rogue access point and capturing network traffic. Our goal is to demonstrate potential vulnerabilities and discuss mitigation strategies.

\section{Related Work}
(Placeholder for related literature on network security, rogue AP attacks, and countermeasures.)

\section{Methodology}
We set up an experimental network environment where unsuspecting users connected to a rogue Wi-Fi access point. Traffic was monitored using packet sniffing tools, and we analyzed the types of data that could be extracted.

\section{Results and Discussion}
Our experiments revealed that unencrypted traffic can be easily captured, and even encrypted data leaks metadata that can provide insights into user activity.

\section{Lessons Learned}
We identified several challenges, including detection avoidance and ethical considerations. Future work would explore more sophisticated attack vectors and countermeasures.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This study underscores the importance of secure network practices. Future research could investigate automated detection of rogue APs and improved security awareness campaigns.
